Technology Trends 
Introduction:
To start with, in this modern era, technology trends change very frequently due to the advancements in technology. Today, people do not want to live a simpler life and also many upgrades are going on in several fields to make life more interesting to live. For example, the increase in internet speed due to the invention of 5g not only helps to escalate life's speed but also causes changes in technological trends.

There are too many trending technologies in the present day and time which are as follows:

Artificial Intelligence:
There is no doubt that AI has changed our life in many aspects. Firstly, the use of AI bots in chats helps users to get solutions to their queries in a few minutes. Secondly, the use of Artificial Intelligence in making creative designs such as logos, graphs, etc. helps people to complete their work in no time. However, there is also a drawback of AI which is just like the machines that it also causes unemployment in the economy







Automations:
Automations are very popular these days as it saves a lot of time and helps people to do more work at a single time. For example, email automations are sent automatically to each user whenever they shop something or discover any websites online. Hence, in the past people send these emails one by one to each customer which consumed a lot of creators' time. 

Digital Marketing:
In the 21st Century, traditional marketing is neither interesting nor too effective. After the Covid pandemic, online marketing developed into digital marketing which helps a lot of people to promote and grow their business online. Some key components of Digital Marketing are Search Engine Optimization, Social Media Marketing, Email Marketing and many more. This technology trend is in demand for modern generations and may have a brighter future.









Quantum Computing:
It refers to learning the latest computer algorithms and statistics to improve the performance of computer softwares. The basics of quantum computing starts with the qubit tool. Furthermore, there are various tools and elements which are used in the process of learning such as trapped ions, photonics, quantum registers, isolation and so on. It is one of the more advanced and difficult courses as compared to the other ones.

Coding and Programming:
Every website, every application and every device works with the help of programming language which is also known as coding. It is a computer language that works with different tools and codes such as python, java script, CC, etc. This language also helps to crack and hack websites, social media accounts and personal data. Additionally, a user can design its own mobile applications and new algorithms with the help of these coding languages. 

Robotics:
The population of robots is very less in the present time, but the future can be full of robots. Infact, some robots are at the stage of testing like the robotic teachers in the USA, food delivering robots in China etc. They can take the place of humans in the upcoming time, only if the government allows their usage as the future is totally uncertain. 









Conclusion:
To conclude, all the technology trends are helpful to adopt only up to a certain limit. These trends may be changing with the time and advancements and many new trends may be emerging in the upcoming future. However, some trends help humans like quantum computing and digital marketing but some endangered humans like robotics and artificial intelligence. 
There are more emerging technology trends such as nanotechnology, 3d printing, cancer vaccines, etc.
